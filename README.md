# AI-Image-Generator
This project is an AI Image Generator built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack with integration of OpenAI's powerful language and image models. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of OpenAI, this application allows users to generate images based on textual descriptions provided by the user.

Key Features:

MERN Stack Implementation: Utilizes MongoDB as the database, Express.js for server-side logic, React.js for the frontend interface, and Node.js for server-side scripting.
OpenAI Integration: Incorporates OpenAI's APIs to generate images from textual descriptions.
User Authentication: Provides user authentication functionality to ensure secure access to the application's features.
Image Generation: Allows users to input textual descriptions and receive generated images corresponding to those descriptions, powered by OpenAI's cutting-edge models.
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
